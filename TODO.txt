| API KEY
Add an API key for every user that allows them to upload posts
externally, e.g. a Tampermonkey script.

| search_max_tags
Maybe make it level-based, so users with different levels can
have different amount of big searches. (English wow)

| LOCKED
Check if a Wiki tag is locked, that it really is not editable by
someone who isn't at least a moderator, idk and I'm lazy OwO

| Prefixes on already existing Tags
Will result in an error. But oh well, this is one thing I can't fix.

| Reports disappearing
Not really happy how reports disappear after approving or rejecting,
but I have no idea how else to solve it.
